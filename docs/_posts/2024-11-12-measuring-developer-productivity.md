Companies and teams have different metrics for measuring developer productivity. Some use lines of code, others story points and some number of tasks done, and probably one of the meaningless ones the number of merge requests.

In reality companies do this because they feel the urge to take control of the productivity of development teams. Therefore not only they need to measure the team velocity but also individual velocity and productivity. There is nothing wrong with the intention. Companies have goals and plans, and they want to be reasonable.

However there's something about software development work that is often overlooked, that it doesn't deal with computers, but with people, and people don't act linearly.

Another fact about people which makes them different than code and computers is that they are complex and unexact. They often times don't act rationally and are susceptible to emotions and external factors.

Therefore many times the metrics and measurements even though sound good in theory end up backfiring and abused, not always intentionally but sometimes intentionally and by management or individuals.

So what is the solution? If we want to improve developer productivity how do we measure the productivity in the first place? Can we even measure producitivity in a meaningful and applicable way? Can we for example see the effect of adopting a new agile approach or a new technology on the productivity of the team?

These are the questions I would like to find the answer to. It's not only important to know the answer as an individual that works for a company but also as a company that wants to improve the productivity of its development teams.

Or maybe even as someone who wants to implement something on their own. How do you measure and improve your own producitity? When you're not dealing with a manager that believes more code equals more productivity, how do you measure your own productivity and improve it?
